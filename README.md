## Data Flow

The application follows a unidirectional data flow pattern:

1. **User Interaction** → Triggers callbacks in UI components  
2. **State Updates** → Component state changes in `ModelBuilder.tsx`  
3. **UI Re-rendering** → Components receive new props and update  
4. **TensorFlow Operations** → Async operations for model building and training  
5. **Callback Execution** → Training callbacks update state with new metrics  
6. **Visualization Updates** → Charts and UI reflect the latest state

### Key State Objects

- `layers`: Array of layer configurations
- `selectedLayer`: Currently selected layer for editing
- `modelConfig`: Training parameters (optimizer, loss, etc.)
- `trainingMetrics`: Accuracy and loss values during training
- `logs`: Console log entries
- `model`: The actual TensorFlow.js model instance

   - Small, focused components combined to create complex UI  
   - Clear separation of concerns between components

2. **Custom Hooks**

The code generation feature translates the visual model into executable code by:

1. Mapping each layer type to its corresponding TensorFlow/Keras code  
2. Preserving all parameters and configurations  
3. Adding appropriate imports and boilerplate  
4. Including dataset-specific preprocessing and training code  
5. Adding visualization code for training metrics

### 2. Intelligent Layer Validation

Before training, the application validates the model architecture:

1. Checks for required layers (input layer, appropriate output layer)  
2. Validates layer compatibility (e.g., Conv2D requires appropriate input shape)  
3. Suggests corrections for common issues  
4. Provides helpful error messages for invalid configurations

### 3. Adaptive Training

The training process adapts to the selected dataset:

1. **MNIST**: Loads image data, applies appropriate preprocessing  
2. **XOR**: Creates the logical XOR dataset with proper shape  
3. Adjusts training parameters based on dataset complexity  
4. Provides dataset-specific metrics and visualizations
